Neural Networks:
    -Neurons are connected to and receive electrical signals from other neurons.
    -Neurons process input signals and can be activated.

Artifical Neural Network: 
    -Mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural networks.
    -Model mathematical function from inputs to outputs based on the structure and parameters of the network.
    -Allows for learning the network's parameters based on data.

h(x1, x2) = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2

Step Function: g(x) = 1 if x > 0, else 0

Logistic Sigmoid: g(x) = ex / ex+1

Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): g(x) = max(0, x)

h(x1, x2) = g(w0 + w1x1 + w2x2)



| x | y | f(x, y) |
| 0 | 0 |    0    |
| 0 | 1 |    1    |
| 1 | 0 |    1    |
| 1 | 1 |    1    |

Gradient Descent: Algorithm for minimizing loss when training neural network.
    

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:
    -Start with a random choice of weights.
    -Repeat:
        -Calculate the gradient based on all data points: Direction that will lead to descreasing loss.
        -Update weights according to the gradient.

Perceptron: Only capable of learning linearly separable descision boundary.

Multilayer Neural Network: Artifical neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer.

Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks with hidden layers.
    
    -Start with a random choice of weights.
    -Repeat: 
        -Calculate error for output layer.
        -For each layer, starting with output layer, and moving inwards towards earliest hidden layer:
            -Propagate error back one layer.
            -Update weights.

Deep Neural Networks: Neural network with multiple hidden layers.

Dropout: Temporarily removing units - selected at random - from a neural network to prevent over-reilance on certa≈ün units.

Computer Vision: Computational methods for analyzing and understanding digital images.

Image Convoluation: Applying a filter that adds each pixel value of an image to its neighbors, weighted according to a kernel matrix.

Pooling: Reducing the size of an input by sampling from regions in the input.

Max-Pooling: Pooling by choosing the maximum value in each region.

Convoluation Neural Network: Neural networks that use convoluation, usually for analyzing images.

Feed-Forward Neural Network: Neural network that has connections only in one direction.
